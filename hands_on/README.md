# Hands-on Sessions Overview

## [-Hands-on 01 – Building solid surfaces](01_build_slabs/)
- Construction of Martini3 models of **silica slabs** using a custom CG builder
- Exploration of surface parameters:
  - bead types
  - surface charges
  - charge
- Construction of **graphene surfaces** using Martini 3 models

## [-Hands-on 02 – Building Solid–Ionic Liquid Interfaces](02_build_interface/)
- Imidazolium-based ionic liquids with different alkyl chain lengths.
- Combining solid slabs with ionic liquids
- Introduction of vacuum / gas regions
- Boundary conditions and simulation setup

## [-Hands-on 03 – Running CG Molecular Dynamics](03_run_md_and_analysis/)
- Running Martini 3 simulations using:
  - **GROMACS**
  - **OpenMM**
- Differences between CG and all-atom MD simulations
- Practical considerations (time step, thermostats, restraints)
- Analysis
  - Partial density profiles
  - Radial distribution functions (RDFs)

# Software environment

The hands-on sessions were tested on Debian Linux systems with the following
software available system-wide:

## Required software

- [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) (2023.3 or newer)
- [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/])
- [Packmol](https://m3g.github.io/packmol/)
- [OpenMM for Martini 3](https://github.com/maccallumlab/martini_openmm) (optional)
